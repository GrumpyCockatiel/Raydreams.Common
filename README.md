# Raydreams.Common

This is just a common C# .NET Core Library I have been using for years, changing and refactoring as needed.

It's mainly used to connect to various data sources since I hate using bloated ORMs.

However, it contains a lot of common code I use and in need of a lot of refactoring and clean-up.

It's not meant for public consumption but you are welcome to look at it and use anything you see.
