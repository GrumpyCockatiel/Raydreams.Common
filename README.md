# Raydreams.Common

This is just a common C# .NET Core Library I have been using for years, changing and refactoring as needed.

Classes come and go as the .NET framework includes more stuff.

I mainly use to connect to various data sources like SQL Server, SQLite, MongoDB and Azure since I hate using bloated ORMs like Entity Framework. The pattern I use here is super simple.

However, it also contains a lot of common code I use but it is in need of a lot of refactoring and clean-up.

It's not meant for public consumption but you are welcome to look at it and use anything you see.

At some point I may document it more thoughly - but probably not because it's really just for my own personal use for now.
